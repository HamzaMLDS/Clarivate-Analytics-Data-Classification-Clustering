# Clarivate-Analytics-Data-Classification-Clustering
Developed a Python-based system to classify and cluster Clarivate Analytics data. Assigned predefined labels (Outstanding, Good, Weak, Very Poor) using a formula, categorized new instances, and applied unsupervised clustering after label removal. Classified additional instances into learned clusters for dynamic data analysis.
