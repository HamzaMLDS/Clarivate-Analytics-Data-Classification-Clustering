**Clarivate Analytics Data Classification & Clustering**

This project focuses on classifying and clustering a dataset from Clarivate Analytics. It involves:

Applying Data Handling Techniques to make Data useable
Supervised Classification: Assigning predefined labels (Outstanding, Good, Weak, Very Poor) using a mathematical formula.
Instance Categorization: Classifying 10 new user-input instances into these predefined categories.
Unsupervised Clustering: Removing predefined labels and applying clustering techniques to group data.
Dynamic Instance Allocation: Classifying 10 new instances into the learned unsupervised clusters.
The project is implemented in Python and optimized for scalability and accuracy.
